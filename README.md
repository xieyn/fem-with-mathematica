# Finite Element implementation for solving plane strain problem in Mathematica

This notebook demonstrates a simple implementation of Finite Element (FE) procedures for solving plane strain linear elastic problem, in Mathematica (or the Wolfram Language). Mathematical formulations for FEM are not presented which can be easily found in any FEM literature. 
Though targeting for demonstration of a simple biaxial compression problem, it can be easily adapted for more complex loading cases. 

The code was written to be as *Mathematica-y* as possible (*i.e.* more functional style), but absolutely not optimized for performance. 

Only PDF version of the file is provided. Original notebook can be sent by email upon request.
